This tiny gem adds a JSON layer to a plain Eventmachine socket connection. Normally when you use socket connections it's your job to implement a protocol that defines a) where messages end and b) how messages are encoded. em_json_connection adds Yajl powered JSON en- and decoding to the game so all you do is writing stuff to the socket thats JSON encodable (Strings, Arrays, Hashes) and implement a callback on the other side that's called each time Yajl has decoded a complete JSON entity. See example.rb for... well... an example.
